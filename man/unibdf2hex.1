.SH NAME
unibdf2hex \- Convert BDF font glyphs into Unifont .hex glyphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B unibdf2hex
<
.I input-font.bdf
>
.I output-font.hex
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unibdf2hex
reads a BDF font file, extracting selected code points and printing
them on stdout in Unifont .hex format.  This program was used to
extract CJK ideographs from the 16x16 version of Wen Quan Yi's BDF
font.  Currently the program is hard-coded to only extract those
code points that comprise the "wqy.hex" source font file used to
build "unifont.hex" but this source code could easily be modified.
